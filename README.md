# Voting App by edlobox

## Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to **[this page](https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/)** and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit [This Page](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects).

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

## User Story:
>1 As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

>2.As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

>3. As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

>4. As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

>5. As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

>6. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

>7. As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

>8. As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

### Note
For this Project, I tried to get a code more modular, clean and easy to understand.
